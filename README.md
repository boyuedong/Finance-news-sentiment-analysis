Automated Finance News Sentiment Analysis with FinBERT (updated nonbinary version)

This project automates the collection and sentiment analysis of financial news headlines from Yahoo Finance using AI. The script runs daily at a scheduled time, scrapes the latest headlines, and classifies them into Positive, Neutral, or Negative sentiment using FinBERT, a financial sentiment analysis model. The results are saved into a CSV file, enabling users to track sentiment trends over time.

	2.	Processes headlines using FinBERT to determine sentiment.
	3.	Saves the data into a CSV file (daily_finance_news_sentiment.csv).
	4.	Runs automatically every day at 8:00 AM
